===========

Simple Lua 5.1 class implementation

This is not a 100% original work. It is derived from one of the basic OOP
implementations on the lua-users wiki, taking different opinions into
consideration to create this final result.

Usage
-----

``` lua
require 'class'

MyClass = class()

function MyClass:__init(var1, var2)
   self.var1 = var1
   self.var2 = var2
end

mc = MyClass('hello world', 5)

= mc.var1 -- => 'hello world'
```
